abstract = {Abstract Background Maintenance of normothermia is an important quality metric in pediatric anesthesia. While inadvertent hypothermia is effectively prevented by forced-air warming, this therapeutic approach can lead to iatrogenic hyperthermia in young children. Aims To estimate the influence of external warming by forced-air on the development of intraoperative hyperthermia in anesthetized children aged 6 years or younger. Methods We pooled data from two previous clinical studies. Primary outcome was the course of core temperature over time analyzed by a quadratic regression model. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of hyperthermia (body core temperature >38°C), the probability of hyperthermia over the duration of warming in relation to age and surface-area-to-weight ratio, respectively, analyzed by multiple logistic regression models. The influence of baseline temperature on hyperthermia was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results 200 children (55 female) with a median age of 2.1 [1st–3rd quartile 1–4.2] years were analyzed. Mean temperature increased by 0.43°C after one hour, 0.64°C after two hours and reached a peak of 0.66°C at 147 minutes. Overall, 33 children were hyperthermic at at least one measurement point. The odds ratios of hyperthermia were 1.14 (95\%-CI: 1.07–1.22) or 1.13 (95\%-CI: 1.06–1.21) for every ten minutes of warming therapy in a model with age or surface-area-to weight ratio (ceteris paribus), respectively. Odds ratio was 1.33 (95\%-CI: 1.07–1.71) for a decrease of one year in age and 1.63 (95\%-CI: 0.93–2.83) for an increase of 0.01 in the surface-to-weight-area ratio (ceteris paribus). An increase of 0.1°C in baseline temperature increased the hazard of becoming hyperthermic by a factor of 1.33 (95\%-CI: 1.23–1.43). Conclusions In children, external warming by forced-air needs to be closely monitored and adjusted in a timely manner to avoid iatrogenic hyperthermia especially during long procedures, in young age, higher surface-area-to-weight ratio and higher baseline temperature.}
